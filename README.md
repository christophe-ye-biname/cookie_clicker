## Here it is: BeClicker !

the clicker game that will get you through an amazing code adventure !

accumulate lines of code to master diffrent languages and some of their libraries ...

## Why ?

this repo is a group-project that we made during our formation at [**Becode**](https://www.becode.org/register/index.html) around november 2019

## What we think about the project:

**Coming soon**

[**Denis Bourgeois :**](https://github.com/Debourgeo)

-   It was pretty hard to know who was doing what at times
-   Git manipulations were good most of the time
-   Too many ideas (not mine), but not enough time for them all
-   Still a WIP, coming blizzard soon

Working in group is always a great and fun way to learn. My feeling about this project is that I'm sure that peoples courageous enough to try **Beclicker** will get as much fun playing it that we had working on it.
